### Project Solution:
The repository is structured in 5 main folders, each of them corresponding to each task.

1. a .md file explaining what we learnt during Pennylane tutorials, and a link to the account where we made some of the corresponding code exercises.
2. use the notebook task2.ipynb to see the implementation of a Variational Classifier.
3. use the notebook task3.ipynb to see the implementation of a Quanvolutional Neural Network (QCNN).
4. use the notebook task4.ipynb to see the implementation of a regression model which predicts many trigonometrical functions (not just a simple sine function :D).
5. For the conspicuity detection, we defined two models:
    1.  a multi-classification model using a QCNN (inspired in task 3). Here, we focus in classifying each of the six categories independently.
    2.  a binary classification model with a Quantum Variational Autoencoder. Here, the categories associated to conspicueties (1 to 5) where considered a unique category, and the good weld the second category. The idea is to diferentiate if the production part is defective or not.
