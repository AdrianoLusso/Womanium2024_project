# Task 1

In task one, we were asked to read the basic tutorials of Pennylane. In particular, the ones in section "Introduction to Quantum Computing
", "Single-Qubit Gates" and "Circuits with Many Qubits". During this time, we have not just read them, but also complete some the code exercises in it. The solution of the exercises have been done in the following Pennylane account:

As summary of what we have learnt, we denote the following points:

* Understanding of the basic theory about qubits, quantum circuits and quantum gates. This allowed us the start developing basic quantum programs.
* Go deeper into the types of Single-Qubit quantum gates that exists. Also, distinguishing them not only by name, but also by their unique features and uses. Different concepts such as phase, amplitude and transpilation got much more clear during the study of these topics.
* We end up playing with de control-gates, allowing the creation of entanglement an quantum control between qubits.
